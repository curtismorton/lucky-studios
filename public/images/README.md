# Logo Assets

Please add your Lucky Studios logo SVG file here as `LOGO.svg`.

The logo will be used throughout the site in:
- Navigation bar
- Footer
- Mobile menu
- Home page hero
- About page
- Contact page
- Favicon and Open Graph images

## File Requirements
- File name: `LOGO.svg` (uppercase - important for case-sensitive file systems)
- Format: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- The logo should work well on dark backgrounds (the site uses a dark theme)

## Optional: Additional Logo Variants
If you have different logo variants (e.g., icon-only, horizontal, vertical), you can add them here and update the Logo component to use them.
